## About the Project

AI arcade is an intruduction to AI designed to be taught to middle and high school students in both English and Spanish. The goal is to get straight into AI utilizing OpenAI's Gymnasium library, and avoid going into too much math or technical jargon. It's a walk through what it's like to use AI to solve game problems that holds your hand along the way. Ideally it should give students a grasp on AI and an idea of what it's like to train models to solve problems. the course is broken down into sections 00 - 04 and a final 10 section for the project.

## Features

- **Visuals** Utilizes Jupyter notebooks for lessons with an emphasis on visuals.
- **Easy Setup** Using Codespaces, the repo can be forked and easily opened in a dev container that is mostly pre configured.
- **Games** Using port forwarding, a remote desktop can be accessed via the browser so the students can test out the gymnasium games by playing them.
  
## Getting Started
